***** Why is your work all encomapssing? I work very hard to keep my 
work, mental issues, as well as my opinions to myself. All I have to do 
is walk in the door, and I'm smacked in the face by another issue you 
have to deal with at work. I understand that you are the manager, and it 
is your job to manage. It is not up to you to save the fucking day for 
all of your useless underlings. Do you think that they'd do the same for 
you? History has already proven this. But, because you must keep your 
nose a shiny, slimey brown; you must make sure all are happy on both 
sides of the ball. Sucking dick and kissing ass all at the same time. 
It's amazing that you are able to breathe.
